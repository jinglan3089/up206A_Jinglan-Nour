### Updated Proposal


For our research project, we will look at the relationship between the distribution of various grocery store chains in Los Angeles County and the presence of colleges. Our research will include looking at grocery store chain distribution and demographics (income, race, and level of education). However, we chose to focus more on colleges since they include a larger variety of people from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Therefore, our project seeks to answer the following question: How does the presence of a college impact the distribution of  grocery store chains in Los Angeles County? 


This project is important because it is a food inequality (social) issue. From watching the documentary Food Inc, we learned that the meat production industry has somewhat shaped people’s eating habits in the United States. For example, fast food is more commonly consumed in lower income communities while organic food consumption is more common in higher income communities. With this food consumption pattern, we wonder if that translates to grocery stores distribution patterns as well? Grocery store chains may vary by availability of high quality food (fresh meat and produce or organic) and price range. Some communities have access to only a few grocery store chains, limiting their options, while other communities have a wider range of grocery stores to choose from. We’ve already seen that there’s a correlation between race, income level and grocery store distribution in LA county. However, while most neighborhoods have a general income level and race characteristics, the presence of college may mix up the demographics of the communities because of the diverse backgrounds of the students. Therefore, our project looking at grocery stores distribution, specifically in relation to colleges and universities, will inform policymakers whether the physical presence of college campuses is a determining factor in grocery chains selecting locations.



For our spatial scope, we will look at LA County. We wanted to study grocery store distribution and location of colleges in LA County since it contains a wide demographic range for income, race, education level among college students. Also, LA county has a large variety of college types (public/private/community colleges) and sizes. Due to the size and demographic distribution of LA County, it also contains a variety of grocery store chains from lower end to high end stores. Therefore, our spatial scope will provide a diverse sample pool for the project.

Our project will first look at the demographics in LA County as a base to our research. We will look at how income, race, and education level is distributed across LA County. Next, we will map universities/colleges and grocery store locations in LA County. Once we have identified their locations, we will begin looking at the type of grocery stores that are most common around colleges (high end or low end). We will also look at whether the type of college (public or private) plays a role in determining the type of grocery store chains surrounding them. Another factor that we will look at is determining whether the presence of colleges in low income neighborhoods attracts higher end stores. We will pick several low income communities with the presence of college campuses and low income communities without college campuses and compare if there is a difference in the types of grocery stores surrounding them. 


We expect to find a correlation between the presence of colleges and distribution of grocery stores. In other words, the presence of colleges would attract a variety of grocery chains to the area, accommodating the diverse backgrounds of the students. We also anticipate that colleges with more students would attract more kinds of grocery chains to the area. Possibly, the presence of colleges in lower income neighborhoods would attract “higher end” grocery stores to the neighborhood. We hope to gain more insight on food inequality in LA County and the factors that influence them.

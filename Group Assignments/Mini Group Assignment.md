### Project title and initial proposal
For our project, we initially wanted to explore How living near freeways impacts hospitalizations rates in LA City? This included looking at air pollution rates in areas near freeways as they relate to hospitalization rates, specifically respiratory illnesses.

### Roles
For now, Nour will be focusing on median income level and Jinglan will be focusing on race across the neighborhoods we want to study. We also want to explore education level, college population, and presence of grocery stores. We will divide the roles by college towns as we go. 

### Status update
After talking to Dr.Yoh Thursday, we felt like we were at a dead end. Initially, we wanted to look at freeway vehicle pollution and its relation to hospitalization rates by looking at datasets of CO2, SO2, NOx, and PM2.5, hospitalization rates in surrounding neighborhoods, and car volumes on different freeways. We wanted to see if there is a “safe zone'' from air pollution. However, after our discussion with Dr.Yoh, we realized that it would be difficult to map a “safe zone” due to the high density of freeways in LA City with our limited coding skill. Additionally, we realized it would be difficult to correlate the respiratory illnesses reported in hospitals located near freeway to residents living in close proximity to freeway due to patient confidentiality.

After a group discussion and trying to find a new approach to our research question, we felt like mapping air pollutants in relation to freeways in LA City would be difficult due to the high density of freeways in LA and our lack of coding experience.  We wanted to pick a research project where we would be able to clearly communicate our research question and findings through mapping. Therefore, we came up with a new research question that we feel would be more aligned with our current coding skills and existing data. Our new research question is: _Is there a relationship between demographics (race, income, education level) and grocery store chains in Los Angeles County?_

For our new research project, we will look at the relationship of the distribution of various grocery store chains in Los Angeles County and the demographics (including: income level, educational level and race) of neighborhoods. Our research will look at low income and high income neighborhoods. However, since it is generally known/easily assumed that organic/more expensive stores tend to open in higher income areas, we wanted to take a closer look at college towns. Specifically, we want to explore several college town areas (such as UCLA, USC, Cal Poly Pomona …). We chose to focus more on college towns since they include a larger variety of people from different socioeconomic backgrounds. This research will explore how the presence of a college/ college town would affect the distribution of grocery stores. 

### Data update
Our data so far includes census data looking at median income in LA City and census data looking at race distribution in LA City. Additionally, we have data mapping freeways in LA City, air quality index, and car volumes (annual average daily traffic) in Los Angeles County in 2019. 

With our transition to a new project, we will be using the census data we found looking at median income and race in LA City. Our plan is to expand on that data to LA County and include data that looks at the location of colleges and college towns and mapping different types of grocery stores across the county. 


### Concerns
- Switching projects and transferring the data sets that we already have to be relevant to our new research proposal. 
- Finding a way to classify the higher end vs lower end grocery store
- Accurately representing the demographics of a college town (race and income). Need to find this information through colleges in addition to census.
